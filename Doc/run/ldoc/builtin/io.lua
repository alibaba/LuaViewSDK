--- Reading and Writing Files.
-- @module io

local io = {}

---
-- Equivalent to `file:close()`. Without a `file`, closes the default
-- output file.
function io.close(file) end

---
-- Equivalent to `file:flush` over the default output file.
function io.flush() end

---
-- When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode),
-- and sets its handle as the default input file. When called with a file
-- handle, it simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When
-- called without parameters, it returns the current default input file.
-- In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
-- error code.
function io.input(file) end

---
-- Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function
-- that, each time it is called, returns a new line from the file. Therefore,
-- the construction
--   for line in io.lines(filename) do *body* end
-- will iterate over all lines of the file. When the iterator function detects
-- the end of file, it returns nil (to finish the loop) and automatically
-- closes the file.
-- The call `io.lines()` (with no file name) is equivalent to
-- `io.input():lines()`; that is, it iterates over the lines of the default
-- input file. In this case it does not close the file when the loop ends.
function io.lines(filename) end

---
-- This function opens a file, in the mode specified in the string `mode`. It
-- returns a new file handle, or, in case of errors, nil plus an error message.
-- The `mode` string can be any of the following:
--   "r": read mode (the default);
--   "w": write mode;
--   "a": append mode;
--   "r+": update mode, all previous data is preserved;
--   "w+": update mode, all previous data is erased;
--   "a+": append update mode, previous data is preserved, writing is only
--   allowed at the end of file.
-- The `mode` string can also have a '`b`' at the end, which is needed in
-- some systems to open the file in binary mode. This string is exactly what
-- is used in the standard C function `fopen`.
function io.open(filename , mode) end

---
-- Similar to `io.input`, but operates over the default output file.
function io.output(file) end

---
-- Starts program `prog` in a separated process and returns a file handle
-- that you can use to read data from this program (if `mode` is `"r"`,
-- the default) or to write data to this program (if `mode` is `"w"`).
-- This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.
function io.popen(prog , mode) end

---
-- Equivalent to `io.input():read`.
function io.read(...) end

-- * `io.stderr`: Standard error.
-- * `io.stdin`: Standard in.
-- * `io.stdout`: Standard out.

---
-- Returns a handle for a temporary file. This file is opened in update
-- mode and it is automatically removed when the program ends.
function io.tmpfile() end

---
-- Checks whether `obj` is a valid file handle. Returns the string `"file"`
-- if `obj` is an open file handle, `"closed file"` if `obj` is a closed file
-- handle, or nil if `obj` is not a file handle.
function io.type(obj) end

---
-- Equivalent to `io.output():write`.
function io.write(...) end

---
-- Closes `file`. Note that files are automatically closed when their
-- handles are garbage collected, but that takes an unpredictable amount of
-- time to happen.
function file:close() end

---
-- Saves any written data to `file`.
function file:flush() end

---
-- Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns a
-- new line from the file. Therefore, the construction
--   for line in file:lines() do *body* end
-- will iterate over all lines of the file. (Unlike `io.lines`, this function
-- does not close the file when the loop ends.)
function file:lines() end

---
-- Reads the file `file`, according to the given formats, which specify
-- what to read. For each format, the function returns a string (or a number)
-- with the characters read, or nil if it cannot read data with the specified
-- format. When called without formats, it uses a default format that reads
-- the entire next line (see below).
-- The available formats are
--   "*n": reads a number; this is the only format that returns a number
--   instead of a string.
--   "*a": reads the whole file, starting at the current position. On end of
--   file, it returns the empty string.
--   "*l": reads the next line (skipping the end of line), returning nil on
--   end of file. This is the default format.
--   *number*: reads a string with up to this number of characters, returning
--   nil on end of file. If number is zero, it reads nothing and returns an
--   empty string, or nil on end of file.
function file:read(...) end

---
-- Sets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the
-- file, to the position given by `offset` plus a base specified by the string
-- `whence`, as follows:
--   "set": base is position 0 (beginning of the file);
--   "cur": base is current position;
--   "end": base is end of file;
-- In case of success, function `seek` returns the final file position,
-- measured in bytes from the beginning of the file. If this function fails,
-- it returns nil, plus a string describing the error.
-- The default value for `whence` is `"cur"`, and for `offset` is 0. Therefore,
-- the call `file:seek()` returns the current file position, without changing
-- it; the call `file:seek("set")` sets the position to the beginning of the
-- file (and returns 0); and the call `file:seek("end")` sets the position
-- to the end of the file, and returns its size.
function file:seek(whence , offset) end

---
-- Sets the buffering mode for an output file. There are three available
-- modes:
--
--  * "no": no buffering; the result of any output operation appears immediately.
--  * "full": full buffering; output operation is performed only when the
--   buffer is full (or when you explicitly `flush` the file (see `io.flush`)).
--  * "line": line buffering; output is buffered until a newline is output or
--   there is any input from some special files (such as a terminal device).
-- For the last two cases, `size` specifies the size of the buffer, in
-- bytes. The default is an appropriate size.
function file:setvbuf(mode , size) end

---
-- Writes the value of each of its arguments to the `file`. The arguments
-- must be strings or numbers. To write other values, use `tostring` or
-- `string.format` before `write`.
function file:write(...) end
